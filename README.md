# Shopify Summer 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge 

Welcome to my repository for the Shopify 2022 Summer Data Science Intern Challenge.

## Regarding the challenge:

The answers for the challenge along with the code are provided in the [Kamalpreet_Singh_Shopify_2022_DataScience_Summer_Intern_Challenge.ipynb file](https://github.com/kamalsinghphd/ShopifyDSChallenge2022/blob/main/Kamalpreet_Singh_Shopify_2022_DataScience_Summer_Intern_Challenge.ipynb). 

**A summary of the solutions is as follows:**

 Q1a) Outliers in the dataset lead to a skewed average.
 
 Q1b) Median (not as sensitive to outliers) can be used to obtain a more accurate description. 
 
 Q1c) Median value is 284. 
 
 Q2a) Speedy Express shipped 54 orders.
 
 Q2b) Lastname of the employee with the most orders is Peacock. 
 
 Q2c) Gorgonzola Telino was the most ordered product in Germany.
